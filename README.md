# E-Funko Frontend 

E-Funko
Welcome to the E-Funko app! This app creates an E-commerce shop where you can view funko-pop characters, edit existing items, delete and add new items. Each item will include a name, price, description and image. You can add a new item by using the hidden form that appears when the "add item" button is clicked. The app also has additional functionality that enlarges the image when a mouse hovers over the image and also a filter where the user can filter by category (i.e. all Marvel characters).

This app is from the perspective of an admin user where you can create a new funko-pop item, edit an existing item or delete an item. 

In the navigation bar, by clicking "Add Item", a form will appear where you can create a new item by entering the name, price, description, image and category. If the category exits, you can use one from the dropdown menu, if not, you can create a new category.

Once created, it will appear on the page and you can access the filter dropdown button which will allow you to filter the items by category.
